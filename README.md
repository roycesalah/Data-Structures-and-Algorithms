# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Projects and Assignments completed in UCSD's Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization


## Courses and their official course descriptions

### Course 1: Algorithmic Toolbox
This online course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.

### Course 2: Data Structures
This online course covers the common data structures that are used in various computational problems.

### Course 3: Algorithms on Graphs
This course, first covers learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. It then covers learn several ways to traverse graphs and how to do useful things while traversing the graph in some order.

### Course 4: Algorithms on Strings
This online course covers key pattern matching concepts: tries, suffix trees, suffix arrays, and the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

### Course 5: Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
This course starts with networks flows which are used in more typical applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. The course proceeds into linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Lastly, it covers inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice.

### Course 6: Genome Assembly Challenge
CAPSTONE project which involves implementing algorithms and ideas spanning all prior courses.
